# React Isomorphic Loadable Example

Example project for [React Loadable](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable)

Introductory blog post: https://medium.com/@thejameskyle/react-loadable-2674c59de178#.6h46yjgwr

**Running locally**

```js
git clone git@github.com:brianc/react-loadable-example.git
cd react-loadable-example
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.  The page is rendered on the server & then react re-renders on the client.

If you want to start with a client-only rendered page you can open [localhost:3000/empty](http://localhost:3000/empty)

You can watch the difference in the web inspector as the lazy loaded component bundles are downloaded.
